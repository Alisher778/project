		<h1>Who are they "Doctors without border"?</h1>
		<img src="image/dr1.jpg" width="800" height="500" alt="Doctors without borders">
		<p>Doctors Without Borders are Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). They help people worldwide where the need is greatest, delivering emergency medical aid to people affected by conflict, epidemics, disasters or exclusion from health care.
		</p>
		<p>MSF-USA was established in 1990 by the French section.They wanted to have a presence in the US in order to expand their international fundraising, recruitment, and advocacy (New York was chosen because of its proximity to the UN and media). The US office has since expanded their role in field operations and is now managing programs in Sudan, South Sudan, Chad, and Ethiopia.
